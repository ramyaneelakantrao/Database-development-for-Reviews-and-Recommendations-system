# Database-development-for-Reviews-and-Recommendations-system
â€¢	As a key team member for an Oracle-based online shopping database project, I specialized in the development and management of the Reviews and Recommendations modules. My responsibilities involved developing PL/SQL procedures that captured product reviews, including generating personalized recommendations based on customer feedback and purchase history. It has been very important for improving customer interaction, customer satisfaction, offering insight into product improvements, and targeted marketing strategies in a competitive online marketplace.
